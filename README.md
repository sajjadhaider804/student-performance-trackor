# student-performance-trackor

## Objective
Develop a **Student Performance Tracker** using Python, which allows a teacher to input student scores, track performance across subjects, and calculate statistics such as averages and feedback on passing or failing. This project reinforces concepts in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, loops, conditionals, and data structures (lists and dictionaries).

## Features
- Track student performance in multiple subjects (Math, Science, English).
- Calculate individual student averages and determine if they are passing or failing.
- Calculate and display the overall class average.
- Handle invalid inputs and prompt for corrections.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed with Python extension.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

First, create a new folder for your project and add the following Python file:
